## Introduction
Userscripts are small pieces of JavaScript code that customize the way websites look or behave. This repository hosts various userscripts that I use, and you can install and use them with your own browser.

## Installation
To use these userscripts, you need to have a userscript manager extension installed in your browser. Here are some popular options:

- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
- [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)
- [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)

Once you have a userscript manager installed, follow these steps:

1. Browse this or other repositories and find the userscript you want to install.
2. Click on the userscript file to view its content.
3. Click the "Raw" button to view the raw script.
4. Your userscript manager should prompt you to install the script. Confirm the installation.

## Usage
After installing a userscript, it will automatically run on the specified websites. You can manage your installed userscripts through your userscript manager extension, where you can enable, disable, edit or remove scripts as needed.
